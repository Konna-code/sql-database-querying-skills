Here is a SQL query example to create a data outout from another query output by using the VIEW and WHERE syntax. 
This specific SQL query was designed to identify top 10 cities withing the top 10 countries.

- Creating a VIEW of the top 10 countries:
## SQL Code

CREATE VIEW top_10_countries_view AS
SELECT
    D.country AS top_10_countries,
COUNT (A.customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.City_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10

- Now adding cities to the SELECT statement and using a WHERE clause to filter for the top 10 countries VIEW in the final output.
## SQL Code

SELECT
    D.country AS top_10
    C.city AS top_10_cities
COUNT (A.customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.City_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
WHERE D.country IN (SELECT top_10_countries FROM top_10_countries_view)
GROUP BY D-country, C.city
ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10
