# üé¨  Data Analysis Project: Databases & SQL
## üìò Project Overview

The project revolves around a former global movie rental company that operated through physical stores. With the rise of streaming services, the company is planning to pivot by launching an **online video rental platform** leveraging its existing movie licenses.

As a **data analyst** in the **Business Intelligence (BI)** department, the primary objective is to support the launch strategy for this new service. This involves loading the company‚Äôs legacy data into a **relational database**, analyzing it using SQL, and answering key business questions across departments.

The final deliverable will be a data-driven presentation to the company board, supported by visualizations, insights, and a technical summary.
