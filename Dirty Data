# Duplicated Values
##
A simple SQL query example to retrieve duplicated film data from a PostgreSQL database.
- Check: Identifying duplicated data by querying a syntax that only shows the
records that are duplicated. If the data output returns no results, it means that there are no duplicated records.
- Fix: If you find duplicate records in your database, there are two ways to fix them:
● Option 1: Create a virtual table, known as a view, where you select only
unique records.
● Option 2: Delete the duplicate record from the table or view.

## SQL Code

```sql
SELECT
film_id,
title,
description,
release_year,
language_id,
rental_duration,
