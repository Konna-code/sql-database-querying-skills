Here is a SQL query example that uses the join syntax and the WHERE clause with an operator, followed by GROUP BY and ORDER BY to produce the desired output. 
-The specific query output was to show the top 5 customers from top 10 cities who paid the highest amount.

- Firstly create a VIEW to show the top 10 cities. 
##SQL Code 

CREATE VIEW top_10_cities_view AS
SELECT
    D.country AS top_10_countries,
    C.city AS top_10_cities,
COUNT (A.customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
WHERE D.country IN (SELECT top_10_countries FROM top_10_countries_view)
GROUP BY D.country, C.city
ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10

- Next was to JOIN the payment table to the query and show the SUM of amount paid.
##SQL Code

SELECT
    A.customer_id,
    A.first_name AS top_5_customer_name,
    A.last_name AS top_5_customer_last_name,
    D.country AS top_10_countries,
    C.city AS top_10_cities,
SUM (E.amount) AS top_5_paying_customers
FROM customer A
FULL JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
FULL JOIN city C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
FULL JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
FULL JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id=E.customer_id
WHERE C.city IN (SELECT top_10_cities FROM top_10_cities_view)
GROUP BY A.customer_id, D.country, C.city
ORDER BY SUM(E.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5
